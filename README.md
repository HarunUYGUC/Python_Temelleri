# Python_Temelleri

- Hello there. I will publish my Python notes in this folder.
- In this folder, I will have step-by-step progress phases.
- So this file will show my crawling stages.
- You can also take a look at my Python notes to learn something.

> My Python notes are from the Udemy course but not exactly the same because I watched the video and then I tried to do what I learnt.
